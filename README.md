## 🚀 How It Works

### Initial State

All menu elements start hidden using:
- `clip-path`
- `yPercent`
- `autoAlpha`
- `scale` and `rotateY`

### GSAP Timeline

A paused GSAP timeline controls:
- Page link stagger animation  
- Info text reveal  
- Title letter transformation  
- Media clip-path reveal  

The same timeline is played when opening and reversed when closing.

### State Control

A simple boolean flag tracks whether the menu is open or closed, keeping the interaction clean and efficient.
